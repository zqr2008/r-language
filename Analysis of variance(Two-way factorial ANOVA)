#Two-way ANOVA


#table statement indicates that you have a balanced design
> attach(ToothGrowth)
> table(supp, dose)


> aggregate(len, by=list(supp, dose), FUN=mean)

#The dose variable is converted to a factor so that the aov() function will treat it as a grouping variableï¼Œrather than a numeric covariate.
> dose <- factor(dose)
> fit <- aov(len ~ supp*dose)
> summary(fit)

#use the interaction.plot() function to display the interaction in a two-way ANOVA.
