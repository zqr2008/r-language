#By default, each whisker extends to the most extreme data point, which is no more than the 1.5 times the interquartile range for the box. Values outside this range are
depicted as dots.

#Box plots can be created for variables by group.
#where formula is a formula and dataframe denotes the data frame (or list) providing the data
#Adding the option varwidth=TRUE will make the box plot widths proportional to the square root of their sample sizes. Add horizontal=TRUE to reverse the axis
orientation.
#adding notch=TRUE, you get notched box plots
