1 Calculate the observed t-statistic, as in the parametric approach; call this t0.
2 Place all 10 scores in a single group.
3 Randomly assign five scores to Treatment A and five scores to Treatment B.
4 Calculate and record the new observed t-statistic.
5 Repeat steps 3â€“4 for every possible way of assigning five scores to Treatment A
and five scores to Treatment B. There are 252 such possible arrangements.
6 Arrange the 252 t-statistics in ascending order. This is the empirical distribution,
based on (or conditioned on) the sample data.
7 If t0 falls outside the middle 95% of the empirical distribution, reject the null
hypothesis that the population means for the two treatment groups are equal at
the 0.05 level of significance.

#formula describes the relationship among variables to be tested. Examples are given in the table.
#data identifies a data frame.
#distribution specifies how the empirical distribution under the null hypothesis should be derived. Possible values are exact, asymptotic, and approximate.
