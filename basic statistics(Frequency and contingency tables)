#turn these frequencies into proportions with prop.table():
prop.table(mytable)


#TWO-WAY TABLES
#the variables to be cross-classified appear on the right of the formula (that is, to the right of the ~) separated by + signs.
If a variable is included on the left side of the formula,itâ€™s assumed to be a vector of frequencies (useful if the data have already been tabulated).
