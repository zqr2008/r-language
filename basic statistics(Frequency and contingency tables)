#TWO-WAY TABLES
#the variables to be cross-classified appear on the right of the formula (that is, to the right of the ~) separated by + signs.
If a variable is included on the left side of the formula,itâ€™s assumed to be a vector of frequencies (useful if the data have already been tabulated).
> mytable <- xtabs(~ Treatment+Improved, data=Arthritis)
> mytable

#generate marginal frequencies and proportions using the margin.table()and prop.table() functions. For row sums and row proportions
#The index (1) refers to the first variable in the table() statement.
#represented the first variable when creating the table
> margin.table(mytable, 1)
> prop.table(mytable, 1)

#Cell proportions are obtained with this statement:
> prop.table(mytable)

#addmargins() function to add marginal sums to these tables.
> addmargins(mytable)
> addmargins(prop.table(mytable))

#adds a sum column alone.
> addmargins(prop.table(mytable, 1), 2)

#adds a sum row.
> addmargins(prop.table(mytable, 2), 1)
