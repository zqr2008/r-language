#Kernel density plots
#general kernel density plots can be an effective way to view the distribution of a continuous variable.
#x=numeric vector. 
plot(density(x))


#The polygon() function draws a polygon whose vertices are given by x and y (provided by the density() function in this case).
par(mfrow=c(2,1))
d <- density(mtcars$mpg)
plot(d)
d <- density(mtcars$mpg)
plot(d, main="Kernel Density of Miles Per Gallon")
polygon(d, col="red", border="blue")
rug(mtcars$mpg, col="brown")

#The sm.density.compare() function in the sm package allows you to superimpose the kernel density plots of two or more groups.
#where x is a numeric vector and factor is a grouping variable
sm.density.compare(x, factor)


#cyl is a numeric variable coded 4, 6, or 8. cyl is transformed into a factor,
#The sm.density.compare() function creates the plot
#a legend is added to the plot via the legend() function . The locator(1) option indicates that youâ€™ll place the legend interactively by clicking on the graph where you
want the legend to appear. The second option provides a character vector of the labels.The third option assigns a color from the vector colfill to each level of cyl.f. The
results are displayed in figure 6.10.

par(lwd=2)
library(sm) 
attach(mtcars)
cyl.f <- factor(cyl, levels= c(4,6,8),
labels = c("4 cylinder", "6 cylinder", 
"8 cylinder"))
sm.density.compare(mpg, cyl, xlab="Miles Per Gallon") 
title(main="MPG Distribution by Car Cylinders")
colfill<-c(2:(1+length(levels(cyl.f))))
legend(locator(1), levels(cyl.f), fill=colfill) 
detach(mtcars)
