#Kernel density plots
#general kernel density plots can be an effective way to view the distribution of a continuous variable.
#x=numeric vector. 
plot(density(x))


#The polygon() function draws a polygon whose vertices are given by x and y (provided by the density() function in this case).
par(mfrow=c(2,1))
d <- density(mtcars$mpg)
plot(d)
d <- density(mtcars$mpg)
plot(d, main="Kernel Density of Miles Per Gallon")
polygon(d, col="red", border="blue")
rug(mtcars$mpg, col="brown")

#The sm.density.compare() function in the sm package allows you to superimpose the kernel density plots of two or more groups.
#where x is a numeric vector and factor is a grouping variable
sm.density.compare(x, factor)
