#plot the actual value
#add the line of model
#From the Pr(>|t|) column,the regression coefficient (3.45) is significantly different from zero (p < 0.001) and indicates that thereâ€™s an expected increase of 3.45 pounds of weight for every 1 inch increase in height. 
#The multiple R-squared (0.991) indicates that the model accounts for 99.1% of the variance in weights.It is also the squared correlation between the actual and predicted value.
