#Spearmanâ€™s Rank Order correlation coefficient assesses the degree of relationship between two rank-ordered variables.

#Kendallâ€™s Tau is also a nonparametric measure of rank correlation.

#PARTIAL CORRELATIONS
#A partial correlation is a correlation between two quantitative variables, controlling for one or more other quantitative variables.

#Testing correlations for significance

#Correlation matrix and tests of significance via corr.test
#The use= options can be "pairwise" or "complete" (for pairwise or listwise deletion of missing values, respectively). The method= option is "pearson" (the default),
"spearman", or "kendall".
