#Transforming variables
#use the powerTransform() function in the car package to generate a maximum-likelihood estimation of the power λ most likely
to normalize the variable Xλ.
#The results suggest that you can normalize the variable Murder by replacing it with Murder0.6
#the hypothesis that λ=1 can’t be rejected (p = 0.145), so there’s no strong evidence that a transformation is needed in this case.

#boxTidwell() function in the car package can be used to generate maximum-likelihood estimates of predictor powers that can improve linearity.
