#One-way ANCOVA

#The ANCOVA F tests indicate that (a) gestation time was related to birth weight, and (b) drug dosage was related to birth weight after controlling for gestation time.

#iuhMultiple comparisons employing user-supplied contrasts
#The contrast c(3, -1, -1, -1) specifies a comparison of the first group with the average of the other three.
#The hypothesis is tested with a t statistic (2.581 in this case), which is significant at the p < .05 level.

#Assessing test assumptions
#ANCOVA designs make the same normality and homogeneity of variance assumptions
#In addition, standard ANCOVA designs assumes homogeneity of regression slopes
#The interaction is nonsignificant, supporting the assumption of equality of slopes.
