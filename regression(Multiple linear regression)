#Multiple linear regression


#Because the lm() function requires a data frame (and the state.x77 dataset is contained in a matrix), you can simplify your life with the following code:
states <- as.data.frame(state.x77[,c("Murder", "Population",
"Illiteracy", "Income", "Frost")])

#Examining bivariate relationships
> cor(states)

#Scatter plot matrix of dependent and independent variables for the states data, including linear and smoothed fits,
and marginal distributions (kernel-density plots and rug plots)
> library(car)
> scatterplotMatrix(states, spread=FALSE, smoother.args=list(lty=2),
main="Scatter Plot Matrix")


> fit <- lm(Murder ~ Population + Illiteracy + Income + Frost, data=states)
> summary(fit)


#Multiple linear regression with interactions
> fit <- lm(mpg ~ hp + wt + hp:wt, data=mtcars)
> summary(fit)


#visualize interactions using the effect() function in the effects package.
#hp:wt:quoted model term to plot
#fit:the fitted model returned by lm()
#list:a list specifying the variables to be set to constant values and the values to employ
#multiline=TRUE option superimposes the lines being plotted.
library(effects)
plot(effect("hp:wt", fit,, list(wt=c(2.2,3.2,4.2))), multiline=TRUE)
