In R, factors are used to work with categorical variables, variables that have a fixed and known set of possible values. ....
Historically, factors were much easier to work with than characters. As a result, many of the functions in base R automatically convert characters to factors.


#because the base installation doesn't include the skew the kurtosis,you need to calculate by the formulas
skew <- sum((x-m)^3/s^3)/n
kurt <- sum((x-m)^4/s^4)/n - 3

Cochran–Mantel–Haenszel test（CMH检验）
The Cochran-Mantel-Haenszel test computes an odds ratio taking into account a confounding factor.
The test creates a series of two-by-two tables showing the association between a risk factor and outcome at different levels of a confounding factor, 
and computes a weighted average of the odds ratios across the strata (i.e. across subgroups or levels of the confounder).

#Comparing more than two groups
If you can’t meet the assumptions of ANOVA designs, you can use nonparametric methods to evaluate group differences. If the groups are independent, a Kruskal–
Wallis test will provide you with a useful approach. If the groups are dependent (for example, repeated measures or randomized block design), the Friedman test is more
appropriate.
