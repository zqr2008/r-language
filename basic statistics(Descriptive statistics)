#where x is your data frame (or matrix) and FUN is an arbitrary function. If options are present, they’re passed to FUN. Typical functions that you can plug in here are mean
#sd, var, min, max, median, length, range, and quantile. The function fivenum() returns Tukey’s five-number summary (minimum, lower-hinge, median, upper-hinge,and maximum).
