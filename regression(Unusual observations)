#Influential observations
#Influential observations have a disproportionate impact on the values of the model parameters
#Cook’s D values greater than 4/(n – k – 1), where n is the sample size and k is the number of predictor variables, indicate influential observations.

#Cook’s D plots can help identify influential observations, but they don’t provide information about how these observations affect the model. Added-variable plots can
help in this regard

#combine the information from outlier, leverage, and influence plots into one highly informative plot
#Influence plot. States above +2 or below –2 on the vertical axis are considered outliers. States
 above 0.2 or 0.3 on the horizontal axis have high leverage (unusual combinations of predictor values).
 Circle size is proportional to influence. Observations depicted by large circles may have
disproportionate influence on the parameter estimates of the model.
