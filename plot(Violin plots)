#A violin plot 


#It is a combination of a box plot and a kernel density plot
vioplot(x1,x2,..., names=, col=)



#vioplot() function requires you to separate the groups to be plotted into separate variables
#Here, the white dot is the median, the black boxes range from the lower to the upper quartile, and the thin black lines represent the whiskers. The outer shape provides 
the kernel density plots.
