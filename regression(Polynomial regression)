#Scatter plot of height by weight, with linear and smoothed fits, and marginal box plots
#the scatterplot() in car package provides a simple and convenient method of plotting a bivariate relationship
#The spread=FALSE options suppress spread and asymmetry information
#The smoother.args=list(lty=2)option specifies that the loess fit be rendered as a dashed line. 
#The pch=19 options display points as filled circles (the default is open circles).
