#bar plots

#Bar plots display the distribution (frequencies) of a categorical variable through vertical or horizontal bars:
barplot(height)

##Simple bar plots
#main is the biggest title, xlab is the label for x axis, ylab is the label for y axis
barplot(counts,main="Simple Bar Plot", xlab="Improvement", ylab="Frequency")

#produce  horizontal barplot
barplot(counts,main="Horizontal Bar Plot",xlab="Frequency", ylab="Improvement",horiz=TRUE)


#If the target is a matrix rather than a vector, the resulting graph will be a stacked or grouped bar plot.



##Stacked bar plot
barplot(counts,
main="Stacked Bar Plot",
xlab="Treatment", ylab="Frequency",
col=c("red", "yellow","green"),
legend=rownames(counts))

#If beside=FALSE (the default), then each column of the matrix produces a bar in the plot, with the values in the column giving the heights of stacked
“sub-bars.” If beside=TRUE, each column of the matrix represents a group, and the values in each column are juxtaposed rather than stacked.

##Grouped bar plots
barplot(counts,
main="Grouped Bar Plot",
xlab="Treatment", ylab="Frequency",
col=c("red", "yellow", "green"),
legend=rownames(counts), beside=TRUE)

##Mean bar plots

> states <- data.frame(state.region, state.x77)
> means <- aggregate(states$Illiteracy, by=list(state.region), FUN=mean)
> means
  Group.1                     x
1 Northeast                  1.00
2 South                      1.74

> barplot(means$x, names.arg=means$Group.1) #The reason that barplot(means) is not applicable is that barplot only receive vector or matrix
> title("Mean Illiteracy Rate")


##Tweaking bar plots
#The par() function allows you to make extensive modifications to the graphs
#increased the size of the y margin (with mar)
#bar labels (with las=2)
#decreased the font size using cex.names=0.8
#"names.arg" makes the input of x axis

par(mar=c(5,8,4,2))
par(las=2)
counts <- table(Arthritis$Improved)
barplot(counts,
main="Treatment Outcome",
horiz=TRUE, cex.names=0.8,
names.arg=c("No Improvement", "Some Improvement",
"Marked Improvement"))


##spinogram
#a specialized version of barplot,barplot is rescaled that the height is 1
#use spine() instead of barplot()

library(vcd)
attach(Arthritis)
counts <- table(Treatment, Improved)
spine(counts, main="Spinogram Example")
detach(Arthritis)
