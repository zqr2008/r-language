#bar plots

#Bar plots display the distribution (frequencies) of a categorical variable through vertical
or horizontal bars:
barplot(height)

#Simple bar plots
#main is the biggest title, xlab is the label for x axis, ylab is the label for y axis
barplot(counts,main="Simple Bar Plot", xlab="Improvement", ylab="Frequency")

#produce  horizontal barplot
barplot(counts,main="Horizontal Bar Plot",xlab="Frequency", ylab="Improvement",horiz=TRUE)


#If the target is a matrix rather than a vector, the resulting graph will be a stacked or grouped bar plot.



#Stacked bar plot
barplot(counts,
main="Stacked Bar Plot",
xlab="Treatment", ylab="Frequency",
col=c("red", "yellow","green"),
legend=rownames(counts))

#If beside=FALSE (the default), then each column of the matrix produces a bar in the plot, with the values in the column giving the heights of stacked
“sub-bars.” If beside=TRUE, each column of the matrix represents a group, and the values in each column are juxtaposed rather than stacked.
#Grouped bar plots
barplot(counts,
main="Grouped Bar Plot",
xlab="Treatment", ylab="Frequency",
col=c("red", "yellow", "green"),
legend=rownames(counts), beside=TRUE)
