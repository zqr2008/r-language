#Wilcoxon rank sum test (more popularly known as the Mannâ€“Whitney U test) to assess whether the observations are sampled from the same probability distribution
#where y is numeric and x is a dichotomous variable
wilcox.test(y ~ x, data)

#y1 and y2 are the outcome variables for each group.
wilcox.test(y1,y2)


> with(UScrime, by(Prob, So, median))
> wilcox.test(Prob ~ So, data=UScrime)

#The Wilcoxon signed rank test provides a nonparametric alternative to the dependent sample t-test. 
> sapply(UScrime[c("U1","U2")], median)
> with(UScrime, wilcox.test(U1, U2, paired=TRUE))
