#Wilcoxon rank sum test (more popularly known as the Mann–Whitney U test) to assess whether the observations are sampled from the same probability distribution
#where y is numeric and x is a dichotomous variable
wilcox.test(y ~ x, data)

#y1 and y2 are the outcome variables for each group.
wilcox.test(y1,y2)


> with(UScrime, by(Prob, So, median))
> wilcox.test(Prob ~ So, data=UScrime)

#The Wilcoxon signed rank test provides a nonparametric alternative to the dependent sample t-test. 
> sapply(UScrime[c("U1","U2")], median)
> with(UScrime, wilcox.test(U1, U2, paired=TRUE))


#If the groups are independent for more than two groups, a Kruskal–Wallis test will provide you with a useful approach.
#where y is a numeric outcome variable and A is a grouping variable with two or more levels.
kruskal.test(y ~ A, data)
> kruskal.test(Illiteracy ~ state.region, data=states)

# more elegant approach is to apply a multiple-comparisons procedure that computes all pairwise
comparisons, while controlling the type I error rate (the probability of finding a difference
that isn’t there). I have created a function called wmc() that can be used for
this purpose.
#The source() function downloads and executes the R script defining the wmc() function
#use adjustment method developed by Holm
> source("http://www.statmethods.net/RiA/wmc.txt")
> states <- data.frame(state.region, state.x77)
> wmc(Illiteracy ~ state.region, data=states, method="holm")


#If the groups are dependent (for example, repeated measures or randomized block design), the Friedman test is more appropriate.
